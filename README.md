Python script that offers more advanced statistics on your grades with the "ecole directe" platform. No information is collected. Features will be added soon to provide even more information.
Required modules are: 
requests, json, urllib, art, matplotlib and getpass4
The application requires the creation of files. I invite you to place it in a place where it can create them.
